1.  Introduction

   Passive infrastructure refers to the underlying infrastructure of a
   telecommunication network that is not actively detectable or
   managable.  It typically includes non-powered, non-communicating
   devices and components, such as cabinets, cables, connectors,
   splitters, antennas, distribution frames, etc., that are either
   hosted within an actively managed device or deployed along the
   physical pathway between active devices.  Passive infrastructure
   serves as physical connections between active network devices,
   forming the backbone for network topology.  As a crucial part of
   communication networks,the inventory information for these devices is
   also essential for inventory management.

   [I-D.draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang] incorporates the
   component concept from [RFC8348] to detail the equipment and holder
   information of a NE.  This encompasses chassis, slot/sub-slot, board/
   sub-board, port, and transceiver.  As these items are recognized by
   the NE through internal protocols, the passive devices that cannot be
   discovered by the NE are thus not included in the modeling and needs
   to be addressed.

   [I-D.draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-location] emphasizes the
   relative and geographic location, e.g. equipment room, geo-loation
   for NE.  A passive device is deployed in a certain location visible
   by the operator, and thus can reference the location defined by
   [I-D.draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-location].

   This document focuses on modeling passive device inventory.  The
   scope of this model is intended to be applicable to a varity types of
   networks, including but not limited to, IP/MPLS, optical access,
   optical transport and microwave networks.  The methods for learning
   about these devices are implementation-specific and fall outside the
   scope of this document.

2.  Examples of Passive Network Inventory

   Network segments built on different technologies share many common
   passive infrastructure components across the system.  To explore the
   practical applications of these components, we can examine example
   scenarios for optical access networks, optical transport systems, and
   microwave networks.

2.1.  Passive Infrastructure in Optical Transport Networks

   Passive infrastructure in optical transport networks serves as the
   backbone for high-capacity data transmission.  Key components include
   fiber optic cables, which act as the primary medium of long distance
   transmission.  Optical connectors, patch panels, and splice
   enclosures are crucial for joining and managing fiber links.
   Couplers and splitters are used for signal distribution and
   combining.

   Within a phyical network element (NE) there are also presence of
   passive components.  For example, fiber optic cables are used to
   connect the ports of different modules within the same or between
   different chassises.  Attenuators, on the other hand, are placed at
   places through connectors or built-in modules for reducing optical
   power.

   Figure 1 illustrates a typical passive infrastructure for a point-to-
   point optical transport network.

2.2.  Passive Infrastructure in Optical Access Networks

   Passive Optical Networks (PONs) are a typical type of optical access
   network with significant passive infrastructure.  The passive
   infrastructure in PON, often referred to as Optical Distribution
   Network (ODN), is the physical optical fiber-based network that
   connects the Optical Line Terminal (OLT) typically hosted in a
   central office to the Optical Network Unit/Terminal (ONU/ONT)
   typically deployed at the user's location.  The ODN is equipped with
   one or multiple cascaded passive optical splitter thus creating a
   physical point-to-multipoint fiber network between an OLT port and
   the multiple connected ONU/ONTs.

   The feeder segment of an ODN refers to the cabling between the OLT
   and the first splitter, whereas the distribution segment of the ODN
   comprises the fiber cabling between the first and second splitter
   stage.  The drop segment comprises the drop fibers between the ONT/
   ONU and the second splitter stage.

   The PON ODN hence comprises optical fiber cables and splitters but
   also many auxiliary components, such as connectors, fiber
   distribution terminals (FDT), fiber access terminals (FAT),
   wavelength co-existence elements, etc.  The passive components where
   the optical signals entering or leaving the optical fibers are split/
   combined or cross-connected are typically hosted in mini cabinets
   e.g. at street corners, manholes, attached to utility poles, etc.

   Figure 2 illustrates a typical passive infrastructure for optical
   access networks.

   *  Passive device: refers to a physical device within a network that
      does not require external power to function, and simply
      manipulates signals through processes like transmission,
      reflection, splitting, filtering, or attenuation without actively
      amplifying or generating the signal.  Examples include optical
      fibers, splitters, couplers, and optical filters, all of which are
      used to direct signals within a system without needing power.  A
      passive device typically does not have management interfaces and
      is typically deployed in a location tracked by the network
      operator.

   *  Active device: refers to a physical device that contains hardware
      and software and is managable through communication interfaces.
      Network elements defined by
      [I-D.draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang] are examples of active
      device.

   *  Guiding media: refers to physical transmission pathways - such as
      optical fiber cables, electrical cables, and coaxial cables - that
      direct and confine electromagnetic signals along a specific route.
      These media provide a bounded channel for data transmission,
      ensuring signal integrity, minimizing interference, and enabling
      high-speed communication over varying distances.  This category is
      also commonly known as guided media or wired transmission media.
      Guiding media can be concatenated to form longer guiding media.

   *  Optical Cable: refers to a type of guiding media that uses optical
      fiber as media to transmit optical signals.  An optical cable can
      contain one or multiple fiber cores, also known as fiber strands,
      each serving as an independent guiding media for data
      transmission.  Optical cables can be spliced or fused through
      joint boxes, optical distribution frames (ODF), or fiber jumpers.

   *  Electrical Cable: refers to a type of guiding media that uses
      metal conductors (such as copper or aluminum wires) as a medium to
      carry electrical signals for communication or power distribution.
      Common examples include twisted-pair cables (such as CAT-5/6 and
      DSL cables), and coaxial cables, which feature a single-core
      conductor commonly used in DOCSIS and MoCA-based broadband access
      networks.  Electrical cables can be connected through splicing,
      connectors, or junction boxes.

8.  Manageability Considerations

   TBD.

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS

   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   [RFC8795] are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   [RFC8795] are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.

10.  IANA Considerations

   It is proposed to IANA to assign new URIs from the "IETF XML
   Registry" [RFC3688] as follows:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-nwi-passive-inventory
      Registrant Contact: The IESG
      XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers the following YANG module in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC6020].

      name: ietf-nwi-passive-inventory
      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-nwi-passive-inventory
      prefix: nwi-passive
      reference: RFC XXXX
