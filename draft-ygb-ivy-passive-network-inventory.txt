1.  Introduction

   Passive infrastructure refers to the underlying infrastructure of a
   telecommunication network that is not actively detectable or
   managable.  It typically includes non-powered, non-communicating
   devices and components, such as cabinets, cables, connectors,
   splitters, antennas, distribution frames, etc., that are either
   hosted within an actively managed device or deployed along the
   physical pathway between active devices.  Passive infrastructure
   serves as physical connections between active network devices,
   forming the backbone for network topology.  As a crucial part of
   communication networks,the inventory information for these devices is
   also essential for inventory management.

   [I-D.draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang] incorporates the
   component concept from [RFC8348] to detail the equipment and holder
   information of a NE.  This encompasses chassis, slot/sub-slot, board/
   sub-board, port, and transceiver.  As these items are recognized by
   the NE through internal protocols, the passive devices that cannot be
   discovered by the NE are thus not included in the modeling and needs
   to be addressed.

   [I-D.draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-location] emphasizes the
   relative and geographic location, e.g. equipment room, geo-loation
   for NE.  A passive device is deployed in a certain location visible
   by the operator, and thus can reference the location defined by
   [I-D.draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-location].

   This document focuses on modeling passive device inventory.  The
   scope of this model is intended to be applicable to a varity types of
   networks, including but not limited to, IP/MPLS, optical access,
   optical transport and microwave networks.  The methods for
   discovering these devices are implementation-specific and fall
   outside the scope of this document.

2.  Examples of Passive Network Inventory

   Network segments built on different technologies share many common
   passive infrastructure components across the system.  To explore the
   practical applications of these components, we can examine example
   scenarios for optical access networks, optical transport systems, and
   microwave networks.

2.1.  Passive Infrastructure in Optical Transport Networks

   Passive infrastructure in optical transport networks serves as the
   backbone for high-capacity data transmission.  Key components include
   fiber optic cables, which act as the primary medium of long distance
   transmission.  Optical connectors, patch panels, and splice
   enclosures are crucial for joining and managing fiber links.
   Couplers and splitters are used for signal distribution and
   combining.

   Within a phyical network element (NE) there are also presence of
   passive components.  For example, fiber optic cables are used to
   connect the ports of different modules within the same or between
   different chassises.  Attenuators, on the other hand, are placed at
   places through connectors or built-in modules for reducing optical
   power.

   Figure 1 illustrates a typical passive infrastructure for a point-to-
   point optical transport network.

2.2.  Passive Infrastructure in Optical Access Networks

   Passive infrastructure in optical access networks, often referred to
   as Optical Distribution Network (ODN), is the physical fiber
   opticnetwork that connects the Optical Line Terminal (OLT) in the
   central office to the Optical Network Unit/Terminal (ONU/ONT) at the
   user's location.  ODN uses one or multiple cascaded passive optical
   splitter to divide the signal from a single OLT into multiple paths
   to serve multiple users using a single fiber.  ODN comprises optical
   fiber cables, connectors, and many auxiliary components.  There are
   multiple types of fibers, including feeder fibers (connecting the OLT
   to a fiber distribution point (FDT)), distribution fibers (connecting
   the distribution point to access points), and drop fibers (connecting
   access points to ONUs/ONTs).  The ODN cabinet acts as a central point
   where different fiber optic cables and components are hosted, and
   these ODN cabinets are often located on street corners, utility
   poles, or other accessible areas along the route to the end users.

   Figure 2 illustrates a typical passive infrastructure for optical
   access networks.

   The following terms are defined and used in this document.

   *  Passive device: refers to a physical device within a network that
      does not require external power to function, and simply
      manipulates signals through processes like transmission,
      reflection, splitting, filtering, or attenuation without actively
      amplifying or generating the signal.  Examples include optical
      fibers, splitters, couplers, and optical filters, all of which are
      used to direct and manage light signals within a system without
      needing electricity.  A passive device typically does not have
      management interfaces and is typically deployed in a location
      tracked by the network operator.

8.  Manageability Considerations

   TBD.

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   [RFC8795] are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.

Internet-Draft    Passive Network Inventory YANG Model        April 2025


   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   [RFC8795] are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.

10.  IANA Considerations

   It is proposed to IANA to assign new URIs from the "IETF XML
   Registry" [RFC3688] as follows:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ni-passive-device
      Registrant Contact: The IESG
      XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers the following YANG module in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC6020].

      name: ietf-ni-passive-device
      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ni-passive-device
      prefix: ni-passive
      reference: RFC XXXX
