<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>Passive infrastructure refers to the underlying infrastructure of a telecommunication network that is 
   not actively detectable or managable. It typically includes non-powered, non-communicating devices and components,
   such as cabinets, cables, connectors, splitters, antennas, distribution frames, etc., that are either hosted 
   within an actively managed device or deployed along the physical pathway between active devices.
   Passive infrastructure serves as physical connections between active network devices, forming the 
   backbone for network topology. As a crucial part of communication networks,the inventory information
   for these devices is also essential for inventory management.</t>

<t><xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang"/> incorporates the component concept from <xref target="RFC8348"/> to detail the equipment and holder information of a NE. This encompasses chassis, slot/sub-slot, board/sub-board, port, and transceiver. As these items are recognized by the NE through internal protocols, the passive devices that cannot be discovered by the NE are thus not included in the modeling and needs to be addressed.</t>

<t><xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-location"/> emphasizes the relative and geographic location, e.g. equipment room, geo-loation for NE. A passive device is deployed in a certain location visible by the operator, and thus can reference the location defined by <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-location"/>.</t>

<t>This document focuses on modeling passive device inventory. The scope of this model is intended to be applicable to a varity types of networks, including but not limited to, IP/MPLS, optical access, optical transport and microwave networks.
   The methods for learning about these devices are implementation-specific and fall outside the scope of this document.</t>

<section anchor="examples-of-passive-network-inventory"><name>Examples of Passive Network Inventory</name>
<t>Network segments built on different technologies share many common passive infrastructure components across the system. To explore the practical applications of these components, we can examine example scenarios for optical access networks, optical transport systems, and microwave networks.</t>

<section anchor="passive-infrastructure-in-optical-transport-networks"><name>Passive Infrastructure in Optical Transport Networks</name>
<t>Passive infrastructure in optical transport networks serves as the backbone for high-capacity data transmission. Key components include fiber optic cables, which act as the primary medium of long distance transmission. Optical connectors, patch panels, and splice enclosures are crucial for joining and managing fiber links. Couplers and splitters are used for signal distribution and combining.</t>

<t>Within a phyical network element (NE) there are also presence of passive components. For example, fiber optic cables are used to connect the ports of different modules within the same or between different chassises. Attenuators, on the other hand, are placed at places through connectors or built-in modules for reducing optical power.</t>

<section anchor="passive-infrastructure-in-optical-access-networks"><name>Passive Infrastructure in Optical Access Networks</name>
<t>Passive Optical Networks (PONs) are a typical type of optical access network with significant passive infrastructure. The passive infrastructure in PON, often referred to as Optical Distribution Network (ODN), is the physical optical fiber-based network that connects the Optical Line Terminal (OLT) typically hosted in a central office to the Optical Network Unit/Terminal (ONU/ONT) typically deployed at the user's location. The ODN is equipped with one or multiple cascaded passive optical splitter thus creating a physical point-to-multipoint fiber network between an OLT port and the multiple connected ONU/ONTs.</t>

<t>The feeder segment of an ODN refers to the cabling between the OLT and the first splitter, whereas the distribution segment of the ODN comprises the fiber cabling between the first and second splitter stage. The drop segment comprises the drop fibers between the ONT/ONU and the second splitter stage.</t>

<t>The PON ODN hence comprises optical fiber cables and splitters but also many auxiliary components, such as connectors, fiber distribution terminals (FDT), fiber access terminals (FAT), wavelength co-existence elements, etc. The passive components where the optical signals entering or leaving the optical fibers are split/combined or cross-connected are typically hosted in mini cabinets e.g. at street corners, manholes, attached to utility poles, etc.</t>

<t>The following terms are defined and used in this document.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Passive device: refers to a physical device within a network that does not require external power to function, and simply manipulates signals through processes like transmission, reflection, splitting, filtering, or attenuation without actively amplifying or generating the signal. Examples include optical fibers, splitters, couplers, and optical filters, all of which are used to direct signals within a system without needing power. A passive device typically does not have management interfaces and is typically deployed in a location tracked by the network operator.</t>
  <t>Active device: refers to a physical device that contains hardware and software and is managable through communication interfaces. Network elements defined by <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang"/> are examples of active device.</t>
  <t>Guiding media: refers to physical transmission pathways - such as optical fiber cables, electrical cables, and coaxial cables - that direct and confine electromagnetic signals along a specific route. These media provide a bounded channel for data transmission, ensuring signal integrity, minimizing interference, and enabling high-speed communication over varying distances. This category is also commonly known as guided media or wired transmission media. Guiding media can be concatenated to form longer guiding media.</t>
  <t>Optical Cable: refers to a type of guiding media that uses optical fiber as media to transmit optical signals. An optical cable can contain one or multiple fiber cores, also known as fiber strands, each serving as an independent guiding media for data transmission. Optical cables can be spliced or fused through joint boxes, optical distribution frames (ODF), or fiber jumpers.</t>
  <t>Electrical Cable: refers to a type of guiding media that uses metal conductors (such as copper or aluminum wires) as a medium to carry electrical signals for communication or power distribution. Common examples include twisted-pair cables (such as CAT-5/6 and DSL cables), and coaxial cables, which feature a single-core conductor commonly used in DOCSIS and MoCA-based broadband access networks. Electrical cables can be connected through splicing, connectors, or junction boxes.</t>

<t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242"/>.  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   <xref target="RFC8446"/>.</t>

<t>The NETCONF access control model <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.</t>

<t>There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   <xref target="RFC8795"/> are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.</t>

<t>Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or

      <t>Traffic Engineered (TE) networks have a variety of mechanisms to facilitate the separation of the data plane and control plane. They also have a range of management and provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources. These mechanisms represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic networking. The term "Traffic Engineered network" refers to a network that uses any connection-oriented technology under the control of a distributed or centralized control plane to support dynamic provisioning of end-to- end connectivity.</t>
      <t>Abstraction of network resources is a technique that can be applied to a single network domain or across multiple domains to create a single virtualized network that is under the control of a network operator or the customer of the operator that actually owns the network resources.</t>

	 <t>   This document defines a YANG data model for Network Inventory
   location (e.g., site, room, rack, geo-location data), which provides
   location information with different granularity levels for
   inventoried network elements.

   Accurate location information is useful for network planning,
   deployment, and maintenance.  However, such information cannot be
   obtained or verified from the Network Elements themselves.  This
   document defines a location model for network inventory that extends
   the base inventory with comprehensive location data.

      <t>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) defined in this document provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices. It uses an Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based data encoding for the configuration data as well as the protocol messages. The NETCONF protocol operations are realized as remote procedure calls (RPCs). This document obsoletes RFC 4741. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use with the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) or the RESTCONF protocol requires a structured and secure operating environment that promotes human usability and multi-vendor interoperability. There is a need for standard mechanisms to restrict NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol access for particular users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content. This document defines such an access control model.</t>
