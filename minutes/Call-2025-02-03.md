### 3. Passive infrastructure
 - Aihua introduced the illustrated diagram on passive infrastructure. 
    - AP: Aihua to separate the figure into access- and transport-specific figures
 - do we consider documents containing information such as coverage of passive infrastructure in access networks to be used by 3rd party ISPs to locate and connect?
 - It could be considered as optional parameters, and may not need standardization
