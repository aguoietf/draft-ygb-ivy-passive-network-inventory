## Discussion

### Draft update for IETF 122
- Present an update on the ongoing discussion
   - Update on scope of passive inventory
   - Terminologies
   - Issues (#6, #7, etc.)

### Issue #6 - Modeling methodology
- Need more discussion on whether the connectivity information between NE/passive device port and fiber cables, and the fiber core connections within a passive device belongs to topology or inventory.
  
### Terminology
- Cable
- Fiber core (a 'strand' of something)
- Passive device

### Examples
- Add example (description and diagram) for cable and fiber cores

Review of notes from last discussion:
1. Introduction to BBF work on topology and inventory related to passive infrastructure
 - Tom noted the development of BBF models for topology and inventory
 - For OLTs it is always in the form of single fibers coming out of OLT ports, so no use of ribbon cables
 - Both fiber cable and fiber cores (strands) need to be modeled.
   - Important to undertand the connections of fiber cores through joints
   - Multiple services can be associated with the same fiber core
 - The mapping between link and fiber core needs to be modeled
   - Topology represents the abstraction layers and is functional
