## Discussion

### 1. Introduction to BBF work on topology and inventory related to passive infrastructure
 - Tom noted the development of BBF models for topology and inventory
 - For OLTs it is always in the form of single fibers coming out of OLT ports, so no use of ribbon cables
 - Both fiber and fiber cores need to be modeled
 - The mapping between link and fiber core needs to be modeled
