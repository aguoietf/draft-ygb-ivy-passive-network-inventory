## Discussion

### IETF 122 updates
- A status update of the passive inventory modeling discussion was presented at IETF'122.
- Feedback #1: passive inventory to consider covering the modeling of intra-NE cable (cables within the same NE). Tracked in issue [#5](https://github.com/aguoietf/draft-ygb-ivy-passive-network-inventory/issues/5)
- Feedback #2: 1:1 link-cable mapping is currently defined in inventory-topology mapping, but seems inappropriate and needs to be further discussed.
  - Do we need this mapping and how? Issue [#2](https://github.com/aguoietf/draft-ygb-ivy-passive-network-inventory/issues/2)
- Feedback #3: Distinction between an optical cable and other passive devices. If you can generalize that to all passive devices, that would be good.

### Issue #10 - Passive inventory for Microwave
- Passive infrastructure for Microwave

### Issue #7 - Scope of passive inventory
- Add examples (description and diagram) for cable and fiber cores
- Add examples (description and diagram) for passive infrastructure (IP, Optical Transport, Optical Access, Microwave)

### Issue #6 - Modeling methodology
- Presentation on access networks
- Need more discussion on whether the connectivity information between NE/passive device port and fiber cables, and the fiber core connections within a passive device belongs to topology or inventory.
  
### Terminology
- Cable
- Fiber core (a 'strand' of something)
- Passive device


Notes from last discussion:
1. Introduction to BBF work on topology and inventory related to passive infrastructure
 - Tom noted the development of BBF models for topology and inventory
 - For OLTs it is always in the form of single fibers coming out of OLT ports, so no use of ribbon cables
 - Both fiber cable and fiber cores (strands) need to be modeled.
   - Important to undertand the connections of fiber cores through joints
   - Multiple services can be associated with the same fiber core
 - The mapping between link and fiber core needs to be modeled
   - Topology represents the abstraction layers and is functional
